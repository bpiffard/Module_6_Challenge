# Module_6_Challenge
The challenge assignment for module 6

#Brief Description
This is meant to emulate a prototype for an App that is meant to pull up hotel options in response to a customer's minimum and maximum parameters. Put an option to add an initnerary, there is no user input for this part, the trip was chosen by me limited by the example temperature parameters imputted earlier. Ideally, would find a way to allow for more user choice here
